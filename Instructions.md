Follow these instructions to set up your Grading Rubric and send student grades:

1. Make sure you're logged into the Google Drive account where you want to keep your student grades.

2. Go the file titled: "Templates.md" on Github, where you should find two links. Please click on both links (they will take you to pre-made Google Drive files).

3. In each of the spreadsheet files, click on File > Make a Copy. This should create copies of each of these spreadsheets in your Google Drive account.

4. After you've made copies of the spreadsheets, go ahead and close those windows/tabs.

5. In your Google Drive, open your newly created files.

6. In the "Grading Template" document, highlight and copy the ID. This is the long string of numbers and letters after "/d" and before "/edit".

7. Open the "Grading Rubric" spreadsheet.

8. Go to Tools > Script Editor

9. On line 9, paste this ID between the quotes.

10. Save the file (click on the disk icon, or File > save), and then close the script editor window.


You've done all of the hard part involving the script code! Now you want to set up your grading rubric. 

1. List all of your students in column A and their Google Drive emails in Column B.

2. Enter your grading categories in the remaining columns. A column named "Notes" should be in the last column. 

3. Enter grades for your students in the relevant categories, and make any comments in the "Notes" column. (The number of categories in the Rubric and Template should be the same.)

4. To send your students the grades, go to Grade Report > Create Grade Report from Sheet.
